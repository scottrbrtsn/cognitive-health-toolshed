# Cognitive improment/enhancement toolset
Tools to track cognitive metrics and monitor progress.

Suggested use:  pick an activity you are interested in, 
especially one you know you are already good at but it doesn't have to be something you know.  
Learning something new can sometimes be more rewarding anyway.  Break down your goal of mastering this skill 
into smaller sub-goals/sub-skills.  So for example, to start to master the olympic clean and jerk, start with 
a deadlift and then progress.  Or say, to learn a new language, start with 100 common words and then progress.  
As you become more and more skilled at even the simplest tasks, you may notice the nuances, and find ways to perfect
them.  So as you are more aware, and more present, your flow and mindfulness scores should increase.  Should you suffer with
mental health issues and are using these tools to get out of a funk, you can use the mental health scales to monitor 
progress there as well.  Theoretically, as flow and mindfulness increase, anxiety and depression scales should decrease.  

WIP (graph not implemented):  After a week you should be able to see a graph of all your scores.  After 30 days, a trend should form as long as you are practicing 
and measuring daily.

Let's describe 3 types of people: the hopeless, the prideful, and the willing. (The spectrum of pride)

 - The hopeless are liars (can they be lifted)
 
 
        The hopeless one says: "Therapy cannot help me, I cannot help myself, 
        no one can help me, I am doomed."  
            -  They think they are at the bottom of the heirarchy. (and that this will never change)
            -  Are on the path towards Marxism.
            -  They are lying to themselves because they don't know/believe the truth.
        The hopeless needs: hope, meaning, a why, truth, examples in human potential
   
   Hopelessness ends in two ways:  end of life, or the injection of meaning/value/prey


- The prideful are liars (can they be humbled)

        
        The prideful one says: "I don't need therapy, I don't need to improve, 
        I don't need help from others, I don't really suffer." 
             -  They think they are at the top of the heirarchy (and that this will never change)
             -  Are on the path towards Tyranny
             -  They are intentionally lying to themselves out of pride or ego
             -  They may not realize this and actually believe they don't suffer or desire anything.
        The prideful needs: to be humbled, to be honest with themselves, to be flanked
        
   Pridefulness ends in two ways: humble themselves, or are humbled by others
        
        
- The willing are honest with themselves (my target)
        
        
        The willing one says:  "Therapy could benefit me, I can help myself, 
        I value others in my life, while I suffer there is hope."
            -  They are brutally honest with themselves on where they stand relative to others.
            -  They know with pursuit, diligence, discipline and faith, they can rise tot he top. 
            
        The willing needs: tools, skills, knowledge, wisdom, inspiration, balance, 
        humility, honesty, support, goals, prey, meaning, value, diligence, discipline, 
        determination, faith.
