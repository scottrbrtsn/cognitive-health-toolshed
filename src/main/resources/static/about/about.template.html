            ...no challenge is too difficult, but some take longer than others...
        <br />
        Where one sees eclectic and chaotic discordance, he sees a niche forming itself into a life-long study of
        cognitive science thru the lens of machine learning and artificial intelligence. &nbsp;Don't believe? &nbsp;

        Molecular soundscapes merging with a profound desire to reach the unknowable,
        Malachiular Sound is created. &nbsp;Merging sound and light together into a cohesive body,
        Scott and Emilie strive to produce high-quality photo-acoustic combinations. &nbsp;Let us customize a
        technical representation for you.<br />
        <br />
        Sound credentials:<br />
        Playing music since the beginning stages of his life, Scott began studying
        rhythm and time at a young age, finally purchasing a drum-set at age 10, started
        toying with melody and harmony with the guitar at age 13. &nbsp;He has since moved to a
        polyrhythmic and multi-cultural study of percussion while desiring to combine specific frequency
        sound in hopes to generate specific soundscapes to elicit desired states of consciousness (sleep,
        focus, attention, meditation, etc...).<br />
        <br />
        Technical credentials:<br />
        Scott Robertson is currently pursuing a B.S. in computer science and has recently finished an
        internship with General Electric. &nbsp;The Software Engineering Apprenticeship Program at GE
        instills the foundations for the development of high-quality products while offering mentorship
        from some of the area's brightest professionals in the industry. &nbsp;Hoping to return for another
        semester, Scott is offering his technical expertise to you for a limited time...so take advantage of
        this bargain before it expires...<br />
        <br />
        Consciousness credentials<br />
        Please consider his technical credentials as a starting point from which he can exponentially
        expand on to successfully satisfy your technical desires. &nbsp;His professional repertoire also
        includes a B.A. in psychology, experience with human factors psychology/engineering at the
        Naval Airwafare Center Training Systems Division, an M.A. in consciousness studies from Goddard College,
        and a research position assisting&nbsp;<a href="http://drchabaud.com/">Dr. Suzanne Chabaud</a>&nbsp;who
        consulted with A&amp;E on their T.V. show called "Hoarders"
